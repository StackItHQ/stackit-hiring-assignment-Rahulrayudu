# StackIt - Google Sheets Integration

StackIt is a Streamlit app that allows you to upload a CSV file, perform data filtering, and send the filtered data to a Google Sheets spreadsheet. This integration is designed to streamline your data analysis and reporting workflow.

## Getting Started

To get started with StackIt Assignment, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Before using the app, make sure you have the following:

- [Python] installed on your system.
- Google account credentials with access to Google Sheets api.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/StackItHQ/stackit-hiring-assignment-Rahulrayudu.git
   cd stackit-hiring-assignment-Rahulrayudu
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages using pip:
   
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Main code Directory:<br/>
    * **api/import_csv.py**

### Usage
  - Run the StackIt app by executing the following command:
  - run the api/import_csv.py file
    ```bash 
    streamlit run filepath.py 
    ```
  - The app will open in your web browser. You can now use it to upload a CSV file and perform data analysis.
  - Upload a dataset by clicking the "Upload a Dataset" button and selecting a CSV file from your local machine.

## Checklist
- [‚úî] My code's working just fine! ü•≥
- [‚úî] I have recorded a video showing it working and embedded it in the README ‚ñ∂Ô∏è
- [‚úî] I have tested all the normal working cases üòé
- [‚úî] I have even solved some edge cases üí™
- [‚úî] I added my very planned-out approach to the problem at the end of this README üìú

## planned-out approach
 - **Google Sheets API Setup:** We need to create the Sheets API and use Create_Service function to create Google Sheets service instance. Get the required API credentials as client_secret JSON file. So, no need to expose the Key 
 - **Imports and Constants:** code starts by importing necessary libraries and defining some constants such as file paths, Google API credentials, and the target Google Sheets spreadsheet ID
 - **Using Streamlit:** a open source framework for make the web application
 - **File Upload:** Giving drag and drop option for user to upload the csv file
 - **Size Constraints:** he uploaded file is read into a Pandas DataFrame (df).
 - **Column Selection:** Users can select columns from the DataFrame they want to work with using the st.multiselect widget.
 - **Data Filtering:** Based on the user's selections, the code filters the DataFrame and displays the filtered data in a Streamlit DataFrame
 - **Data Import to Google Sheets:** send the filtered data to a Google Sheets spreadsheet
